# ResNet + FCN (tensorflow version) for Semantic Segmentation

## Notice
The code of the architecture of ResNet is from ry/tensorflow-resnet. And the code of some function of FCN is from MarvinTeichmann/tensorflow-fcn. At the same time, I read the code of shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow. 
Thank ry, MarvinTeichmann and shekkizh :-)

## How to use it ?

1. git clone https://github.com/wkcn/resnet-fcn.tensorflow

2. Enter the directory that resnet-fcn.tensorflow

3. git clone https://github.com/wkcn/tensorflow-resnet
It is forked from ry/tensorflow-resnet, and it supports python3 and new version of tensorflow.
