# ResNet + FCN (tensorflow version) for Semantic Segmentation

## Notice
The code of the architecture of ResNet is from [ry/tensorflow-resnet](https://github.com/ry/tensorflow-resnet). 

The code of some function of FCN is from [MarvinTeichmann/tensorflow-fcn](https://github.com/MarvinTeichmann/tensorflow-fcn). 

At the same time, I read the code of [shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow](https://github.com/shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow). 

Thank ry, MarvinTeichmann and shekkizh :-)
